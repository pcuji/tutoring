    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Bart’s Cinnamon Rolls Recipe – This cinnamon roll recipe produces perfectly light and fluffy cinnamon rolls every time! So simple to make, this is a family favorite cinnamon roll recipe!"</p>
    <p>Cinnamon rolls are one of my favorite things in the whole wide world.</p>
    <p>Good cinnamon rolls that is.</p>
    <p>I hate to say it, but I’m kinda picky about them.</p>
    <p>I like my cinnamon rolls to be tender and not too bready, with the perfect ratio of cinnamon, and with just the right amount of cream cheese icing on the top.</p>
    <p>My mouth is watering just thinking about them.</p>
    <p>I have a confession to make about this recipe.</p>
    <p>It’s my husband’s.</p>
    <p>He is the cinnamon roll maker around our house and until recently, he kept his recipe a secret.</p>
    <p>He took his mother’s prized cinnamon roll recipe and tweaked it just a bit to turn out the most absolutely perfect cinnamon rolls I’ve ever tasted.</p>
    <p>Goodness gracious am I ever thankful he’s finally sharing his recipe.</p>
    <p>I think you’ll be pretty thankful for his cinnamon roll recipe, too.</p>
    <p>Here’s how he makes them.</p>

  <section id="three">
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h5>Cinnamon Roll Dough</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Add yeast and sugar to warm milk in a large bowl. Stir gently to combine and allow the yeast to foam to proof. Once the yeast has proofed, stir in melted butter, salt, eggs, and flour into yeast mixture. Gently mix until well-combined.</li>
      <li>Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10-12 minutes. Form the dough into a large ball and place into a large buttered glass bowl. Cover lightly with plastic or with a tea towel and place in a warm location free of any drafts. Allow to rise so that the dough is doubled in size.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <h5>Cinnamon Roll Filling</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Place dough on a large lightly floured surface and roll to a ¼ inch thickness. Spread softened butter over the top of the dough.</li>
    <li>Stir together the brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle generously all over the buttered dough</li>
    <li>Tightly roll the dough, beginning at the long edge, until a log of dough has been formed.</li>
    <li>Cut the dough into ¾-inch to 1-inch slices and place onto a lightly buttered sheet pan.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Baking and Icing</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400º Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>Allow rolls to rise for 30 minutes on sheet pan</li>
    <li>Place rolls into oven and allow to cook until lightly browned and cooked through, but not overcooked, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>While cinnamon rolls are baking, prepare cream cheese frosting by creaming together butter, confectioner's sugar, cream cheese, vanilla and salt.</li>
    <li>Remove cinnamon rolls from the oven and allow to cool slightly.</li>
    <li>Spread frosting generously over rolls while they are warm.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Extra</h5>
  <p>Stand Mixer Instructions: Use your stand mixer fitted with the dough hook once the yeast has proofed. Stir in melted butter, salt, eggs, and flour. Gently mix until well-combined. Continue using the dough hook to knead dough in mixer for 6-8 minutes. Continue on with the recipe as instructed.</p>
